# Code your project

## Overview

**Throughout the rest of the term we’ll be working on the design of a complete independent website.** The subject matter independent project website is completely your choice.

- *Fork this repository.*
- Code the whole website you planned for your indepenent project.
- Create a multi-page website: Home, +2 more pages.
- *It should have real text content.*
- It should be completely designed, with real images, real colours—and it should look amazing.
- **Don’t steal images**—[use properly licensed images](https://cg.algonquindesign.ca/administration/stock.html). If the image requires that you credit the author use a [`humans.txt`](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/search-engine-optimization/#humanstxt) file. ([See an example `humans.txt` file](https://github.com/acgd-webdev-3/modularity-mindfulness/blob/gh-pages/humans.txt)).
- *The website should obviously be fully responsive: working on screensizes from `320px` all the way to `~2500px`.*
- **Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.**

## Teacher’s expectations

This website is to prove that you—by yourself—can do everything we covered in class. Look back over all the assignments from the term, determine what kernel of knowledge they were trying to teach you, and see if you can implement it in this website.

There should be a significant example of everything we’ve learned this term in this website. **Leave the impression that you’re confident with what we’ve learned and can apply everything.**

## Markbot’s expectations

### All HTML files

- `header`, `header nav`, `header nav li`, `header nav a`
- `main`, `h2`, `div`, `img`, `footer`, `section` or `article`
- `main.css`
- A `color` or `background-color` hover state on the navigation
- A unique `<title>` & `<h1>` for everything HTML page
- Focus states on the navigation and links in the main body content
- ARIA roles & proper accessibility & colour contrast
- Fits within the [standard performance budget](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/performance-checklist/)
- Passes all [accessibility checks](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/topics/accessibility-checklist/) including skip links and ARIA landmark roles
- *Google Fonts are optional—you may decided they have too much of a performance impact.*

### CSS file

CSS requirements are really open—just make sure the CSS is valid & indented properly.

### Images

- All images should be smushed, with a maximum file size of `250kB` and maximum dimensions of `2500px`
- Proper favicons, `favicon.ico` & `favicon-196.png`

## Browser & accessibility testing

In class, week 14, we will be doing lots of peer testing—most of the website needs to be complete by then.

Each person will be assigned a tool and will be required to test everybody’s websites.

- [Accessibility testing](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/courses/shared/accessibility-testing/)
- [Browser testing](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/courses/shared/browser-testing/)
- [Performance testing](https://learn-the-web.algonquindesign.ca/courses/shared/performance-testing/)

## Hand in

Drop this folder into your Markbot application. Make sure to fix all the errors. And submit for grades using Markbot.

**When you submit to Progressinator, you’ll see a grey checkmark that shows the project was handed in.** You’ll still have to write a *Request for Grade* and the teacher will still be grading it personally.
