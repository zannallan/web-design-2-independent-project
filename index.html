    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>We are an all Dachshund dog rescue located in Ottawa, Ontario. We have both purebred and mixed breed Dachshunds that are looking for forever homes! Our founder, Susanna Allan, had a vision, and that vision was to provide the best care, and rehabilitation for all wiener dogs who have either been abandoned or abused. She owned Dachshunds all her life and this was where her love of the breed came from. To Learn more about the Dachshund breed, please visit the link provided!</p>

        <h3>Brownie Age: 5yrs.</h3>
        <p>Brownie is an older boy here at the rescue, he was saved from a hole near a park where he got stuck trying to chase a rabbit. His owners were not located and was later taken in by Zann's Wiener Rescue. He is a fun loving boy, a little bratty, but great with people. He like to bark so his forever home would be better outside of the city. </p>
